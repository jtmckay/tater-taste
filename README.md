# tater-taste
Tater - TypeScript Abstract Syntax Tree Explorer

Explore your codebase visually, and follow code paths more easily. Don't get lost (hopefully).

## Get Started

Analyze your code base using `npx tater-taste@latest`

Arguments: specify the entry file if it is not in the current directory and named index.ts by passing the path as an argument. EG: `npx tater-taste@latest client/src/App`

## Contributing

Start a local server using `yarn start`

To work on changes to the frontend, run `yarn watch` concurrently.

To publish changes, make sure to compile the code using `yarn build` first.
